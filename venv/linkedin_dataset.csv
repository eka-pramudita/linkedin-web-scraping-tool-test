Anything data-related within growth, digital inclusion, or risk and fraud for GoPay is what our team is concerned about✌

The honorary person then will decide what fun activities we can do together . This is especially an important tradition for us with WFH becoming more normalized. While we do miss our monthly outings/dinners, thank goodness for the invention of Slack and Zoom calls that keep us feeling close.
